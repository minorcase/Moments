Moments is a web application that allows users to relive their California concert experiences.

It utilizes the Twitter, Google, Youtube, and bandsintown APIs to generate its content. Content is dynamically appended using Javascript and jQuery.

If I had to do this project over again, I would love to flesh out the artist and tour information modals. This would be a little difficult to do as we were not able to find artist bios or tour information through any APIs.

I really enjoyed working on this project. I acted as the Project Manager and it was fun to have so many different types of responsibilities: helping others with issues, integrating separate chunks of code into one application, and designing wireframes with the group.
